# Ender 7 - Klipper Configuration - OPTIMIZED
# Hardware: CoreXY | BDsensor | TZ E3 2.0 Hotend | HGX Lite Extruder
# Host: BTT Pi v1.2 (Armbian, /tmp/klipper_host_mcu)
# Board: STM32F103 (28KiB bootloader, USART1 PA10/PA9)
#
# CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL:
# 1. probe_count: 50,50 → 9,9  [CRITICAL - was ~83 minutes per mesh!]
# 2. safe_z_home: 125,125 → 130,130  [nozzle now at true bed center]
# 3. zero_reference_position: 125,125 → 165.5,104.5  [probe coords at nozzle center]
# 4. mesh_min: 36,26 → 40,5  [better front coverage with correct Y math]
# 5. mesh_max: 222,224 → 255,230  [extended X coverage by 33mm]
# 6. [input_shaper] moved from SAVE_CONFIG to active section
#    ⚠️  WARNING: shaper_freq_x = 106.0Hz is EXTREMELY HIGH - re-run ADXL test
#    ⚠️  Y shaper is MISSING from original - added placeholder, must be tuned
# 7. CANCEL_PRINT: parks at X0 → X5  [was slamming into X endstop]
# 8. [firmware_retraction] section added
# 9. [gcode_arcs] added (resolution 0.1mm)
# 10. pressure_advance starting value added (0.04 for HGX Lite direct drive)
# 11. Load/Unload distances corrected for direct drive (was set for Bowden)
# 12. SAVE_CONFIG bed mesh cleared (last 2 rows were corrupted - re-run BED_MESH_CALIBRATE)
# 13. [exclude_object] removed (already in start.cfg)
# 14. Added [include macros.cfg]
#
# ⚠️  HGX LITE ROTATION_DISTANCE NOTE:
#    Current: 5.7 | Typical stock HGX Lite: ~4.76 (7.5:1 gear, ~35.7mm circumference)
#    5.7 is ~20% high. Either it was calibrated this way OR it's wrong.
#    VERIFY by extruding 100mm and measuring actual filament movement.
#    Command: CALIBRATE_EXTRUDER NOZZLE_DIAMETER=0.4 or manual E-step calibration.

# ----------------- INPUT SHAPER -----------------
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: shaper_freq_x = 106.0Hz is suspicious for an Ender 7.
#    Typical range for CoreXY: 50-80Hz. 106Hz could indicate:
#    - Accelerometer was mounted to the frame instead of the toolhead
#    - A loose/resonant mount that created false harmonics
#    - Genuine high frequency (possible but uncommon)
#    RECOMMENDED: Re-run ADXL resonance test with accelerometer firmly
#    mounted directly to the printhead carriage. 
#
# ⚠️  Y SHAPER WAS MISSING: Placeholder values added below.
#    You MUST run SHAPER_CALIBRATE to get correct Y values before printing.
#    Leave Y commented out until tuned.

#shaper_freq_y: 55.0    # ⚠️  PLACEHOLDER - must be tuned!

# ⚠️  HGX LITE ROTATION_DISTANCE: 5.7 kept from original.
#    Stock HGX Lite is typically ~4.76. If you are over/under extruding,
#    calibrate with: https://www.klipper3d.org/Rotation_Distance.html
#    E-step calibration method:
#    1. Heat nozzle, mark filament 120mm from extruder
#    2. Extrude 100mm (MOVE_EXTRUDER DISTANCE=100)
#    3. Measure remaining distance to mark, adjust rotation_distance proportionally
